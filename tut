Build it from source

DWM is very light. All the configuration is made at compile time, so if you want some customization the way to do it is to build it.

First, get git and dependencies:

    $ sudo apt-get install git xorg libx11-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev xdm suckless-tools dmenu

Then clone it:

    $ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm

Check the ‘config.h’ file and if you’re happy with it:

    $ sudo make clean install

Create a .xsession file with ‘dwm’:

    $ echo “exec -dwm” > .xsession

And reboot.
